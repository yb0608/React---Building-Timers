## Design Spec

### Consistancy
1. Removed chrome default outline for better and consistant UI for the user. (The outline color doesn't match white outlines for my input areas).
2. Overall font is very gamic in respond to my theme.
3. Functional buttons assigned with colors to differ from selection buttons.
4. Timer background changes and highlights when it is triggered and running.And it's different from defalut grey status.
5. Clock area is highlighted and enlarged to emphasize the importance on time and making sure that user's attention and focus point is always on the clock part.
6. In XY and TABATA timers, showing current round is to keep user informed how much time has passed. And specifically in TABATA timer, showing the status of workTime and restTime is an design intention to let user better keep track of time.
7. Functionality of "Add Timer" and "Remove": they were both designed to be visible only when timers are not running , in pause, reset, and initial states, user can modify timers, either adding more or remove a timer. When a timer is removed, total workout time will be updated as well.
8. Keeping timer message at two places (top & end) is a design intention to let user immediately know what is the state of the timers., incase the timer list gets too long and the user has to scroll all the way up to find out the state of timers.

### Color 
1. Purple because it's rare in nature and often perceived as universe, mystery, magic, surrealness. So using purple hues in general is a better choice to represent the out space. (Attahced a milkyway photograph.)
2. Message background is consist with the color when timer is running, so as to maintain a unified UI.
3. Green symbolizes working, ready,stable, progrssing. Using green to indicate that the timer has started and it's working and progressing.
4. Yellow can mean on hold, wait. Thus using yellow color for the remove button to offer user a chance to think and made the decision to remove a timer.
5. Blue is a very calm and peaceful color and less emotionly and visually strong as red, yellow and green, thus is being used on reset button when the timer is set to intial status and also indicating that the timer is "cooled down" and ready.
6. Red symbolizes importance,alarm, stop. Giving the pause button the color red to let users know that the timer has been paused.

## Documentation
In this assignment, I'm keeping the theme and overall outter space feeling from Assignment 2 and adding more dynamic UI feature to it.
